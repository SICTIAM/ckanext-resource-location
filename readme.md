#ckanext-location
This extension is meant to add location fields at the end of csv field 
when they are uploaded and contain addresses.

**Requires CKAN Version 2.7.2 or higher.**

##Installation Instructions

- Add the ckanext-location folder in the same folder as your other extensions
- Make sure your virtualenv is activated :
```

```

```

##How it works
When uploading a new csv resource to a dataset, fill the fields address, 
city and zipcode fields with the number of the column corresponding 
to these in your file and click ```Add```, the file will be automatically
processed and latitude and longitude columns will be added at the end of your file, 
giving you the coordinates of each address.

##Language management
- To add new translation, make sure you have babel install in your virtual environment,
if not run :
```
pip install --upgrade Babel
```
- Change to the language folder :
```
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckanext-location/ckanext/location/i18n
```
- Create the file setup.cfg:
```
nano setup.cfg
```

```
[extract_messages]
keywords = translate isPlural

output_file = ckanext/location/i18n/ckanext-location.pot
